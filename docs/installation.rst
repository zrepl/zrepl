Installation
============

.. TIP::

    Note: check out the :ref:`tutorial` if you want a first impression of zrepl.

User Privileges
---------------

It is possible to run zrepl as an unprivileged user in combination with
`ZFS delegation <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/zfs-zfs-allow.html>`_.
Also, there is the possibility to run it in a jail on FreeBSD by delegating a dataset to the jail.
However, until we get around documenting those setups, you will have to run zrepl as root or experiment yourself :)

Packages
--------

zrepl source releases are signed & tagged by the author in the git repository.
Your OS vendor may provide binary packages of zrepl through the package manager.
Additionally, `binary releases`_ are provided on GitHub.
The following list may be incomplete, feel free to submit a PR with an update:

Compile From Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Producing a release requires **Go 1.11** or newer and **Python 3** + **pip3** + ``docs/requirements.txt`` for the Sphinx documentation.
A tutorial to install Go is available over at `golang.org <https://golang.org/doc/install>`_.
Python and pip3 should probably be installed via your distro's package manager.

Alternatively, you can use the Docker build process:
it is used to produce the official zrepl `binary releases`_
and serves as a reference for build dependencies and procedure:

::

    git clone https://github.com/zrepl/zrepl.git
    cd zrepl
    sudo docker build -t zrepl_build -f build.Dockerfile .
    sudo docker run -it --rm \
        -v "${PWD}:/src" \
        --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
        zrepl_build make release

Alternatively, you can install build dependencies on your local system and then build in your ``$GOPATH``:

::

    mkdir -p "${GOPATH}/src/github.com/zrepl/zrepl"
    git clone https://github.com/zrepl/zrepl.git "${GOPATH}/src/github.com/zrepl/zrepl"
    cd "${GOPATH}/src/github.com/zrepl/zrepl"
    python3 -m venv3
    source venv3/bin/activate
    ./lazy.sh devsetup
    make release

The Python venv is used for the documentation build dependencies.
If you just want to build the zrepl binary, leave it out and use `./lazy.sh godep` instead.
Either way, all build results are located in the ``artifacts/`` directory.

.. NOTE::

    It is your job to install the apropriate binary in the zrepl users's ``$PATH``, e.g. ``/usr/local/bin/zrepl``.
    Otherwise, the examples in the :ref:`tutorial` may need to be adjusted.

What next?
----------

Read the :ref:`configuration chapter<configuration_toc>` and then continue with the :ref:`usage chapter<usage>`.

**Reminder**: If you want a quick introduction, please read the :ref:`tutorial`.
