zrepl is a spare-time project primarily developed by `Christian Schwarz <https://cschwarz.com>`_.
You can support maintenance and feature development through one of the services listed above.
For SEPA wire transfer and **commerical support**, please `contact Christian directly <https://cschwarz.com>`_.

.. NOTE ::

   PayPal takes a relatively high fixed processing fee plus percentage of the donation.
   Larger less-frequent donations make more sense there.
