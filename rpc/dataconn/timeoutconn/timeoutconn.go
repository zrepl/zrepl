	// A call to CloseWrite indicates that no further Write calls will be made to Wire.
	// The implementation must return an error in case of Write calls after CloseWrite.
	// On the peer's side, after it read all data written to Wire prior to the call to
	// CloseWrite on our side, the peer's Read calls must return io.EOF.
	// CloseWrite must not affect the read-direction of Wire: specifically, the
	// peer must continue to be able to send, and our side must continue be
	// able to receive data over Wire.
	//
	// Note that CloseWrite may (and most likely will) return sooner than the
	// peer having received all data written to Wire prior to CloseWrite.
	// Note further that buffering happening in the network stacks on either side
	// mandates an explicit acknowledgement from the peer that the connection may
	// be fully shut down: If we call Close without such acknowledgement, any data
	// from peer to us that was already in flight may cause connection resets to
	// be sent from us to the peer via the specific transport protocol. Those
	// resets (e.g. RST frames) may erase all connection context on the peer,
	// including data in its receive buffers. Thus, those resets are in race with
	// a) transmission of data written prior to CloseWrite and
	// b) the peer application reading from those buffers.
	//
	// The WaitForPeerClose method can be used to wait for connection termination,
	// iff the implementation supports it. If it does not, the only reliable way
	// to wait for a peer to have read all data from Wire (until io.EOF), is to
	// expect it to close the wire at that point as well, and to drain Wire until
	// we also read io.EOF.
	CloseWrite() error

	// Wait for the peer to close the connection.
	// No data that could otherwise be Read is lost as a consequence of this call.
	// The use case for this API is abortive connection shutdown.
	// To provide any value over draining Wire using io.Read, an implementation
	// will likely use out-of-band messaging mechanisms.
